## My Process

Started with building app functionality before adding styling with CSS (this is the oppositive of how I've done things before).

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJS

### What I learned 

In React 18, `useEffect` runs twice in `<StrictMode>` during development in order "to find bugs caused by impure rendering", "to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup", and "to be checked for usage of deprecated APIs". 

Using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to ensure the answers were properly shuffled. 

### Useful Resources

- The following resources were particlarly helpful in understanding by `useEffect` runs twice in `<StrictMode>`: 
  - [StackOverlfow: UseEffect being called multiple times](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73369651)
  - [React Docs: My Effect runs twice when component mounts](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#my-effect-runs-twice-when-the-component-mounts)
  - [Techiediaries: React 18 useEffect runs twice](https://www.techiediaries.com/react-18-useeffect/)
  - [React Docs: `<StrictMode>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode#strictmode)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - I used this quite regularly when I was stuck and needed to "someone" to bounce ideas off of or get a hint for where to go next. 
  - ChatGPT led me to the idea of using the Fisher-Yates Algorithm, but it was these two articles that helped me understand it more deeply: 
    - [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://www.programming-algorithms.net/article/43676/Fisher-Yates-shuffle)
    - [Why is fisher yates the most useful shuffling algorithm?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2459307)
